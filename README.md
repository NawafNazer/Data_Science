Prepared By: Nawaf Jamil Nazer


In this project we will study the discipline in the flights schedule, and we will generate graphical report to represent which airport has more delay and what are the reasons 

Then we will build a scientific model to predict the flights schedule delay in the future

In this study we will depend on data provided from: kaggle.com

Scheduled Departure and Arrival Time
Actual Departure and Arrival Time

Scheduled Total Flight Time
Reason for the delay by Time (Carrier, Weather, Security or National Aviation )
